I've recently gotten sucked into an old childhood video game that I used to adore: Final Fantasy X. I rationalized/reasoned that "if I can find a way to relax, absorb a good story arc, and clear my mind of stressors, then it would be worth my time". With this mindset, I engrossed myself in the game, spending as much as 6 hours each day progressing through the story. I was invested.

As I got closer to the end of the game, I started to deviate from the main storyline and do some side-quests. Most of these still satisfied the reasons I got into the game in the first place, so I had no issue in doing them. But then I became set on getting the best weapon in the game for one of my characters. To accomplish this, a fair amount of brutal and long drawn-out grinding is involved. I took this on willingly.

I soon realized what I was doing and decided to stop immediately, though many hours had already been wasted. I realized an important point though. You must have a clear purpose for whatever it is you are doing front and center in your mind. When we get lost in the weeds of a new world, it doesn't take long to develop new priorities. It's possible these new priorities are superior to the old ones, but it's certainly a question worth being aware of and asking.
